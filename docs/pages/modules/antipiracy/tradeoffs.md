# Tradeoffs
kevlar is not an antivirus. It is not designed to be on that end of the spectrum. It is an heuristic to *quickly* catch *most* of the junk installed on the device.

As a general rule of thumb:

- If you want more precision, you need more time (There are advanced and stricter checks used in financial software: archive and directory scanning, extended signature checks, and everything done with professional security software, but doing that [defeats the purpose](../../overview/philosophy.md)).
- If you want less running time, you will have less precision.
