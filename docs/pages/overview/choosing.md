# Choosing packages

Kevlar's flexible infrastructure allows for very granular and efficient configuration.

it is divided in 3 packages, each targeting a specific scope (system-wise security, user-wise security and app-wise security), and within each package you have fully customizable attestation checks. 

This is done to help you reach your desired security level and only bundle in your app what you need.
