# Attitude

Kevlar may be used in some instances to gather information and eventually act upon them in ways that can be considered immoral or unjust.
Namely, denying service (or parts of service) to some users or systems is a controversial decision.

**Kevlar is only a tool**, and as such has no behaviour or attitude embedded within it.

Developers using this library or implementing similar behaviours should choose carefully what to do after the data has been gathered.

	There is a broad spectrum of opinions regarding this topic. 
	On one end, people will want full freedom and access over the device they bought and use daily, and they are right.
	On the other end, developers do not want their software to be pirated, hacked, cracked, bypassed, abused as this has negative consequences all around the app, and they are right. 

	Personally I think it depends on what kind of detection you implement: If I try to crack a software and said software doesn't let me I'd feel angry but I know I'm doing something wrong, which would damage the developers. 
	On the other hand, apps denying service because I have a custom ROM or a magisk rooted phone when I had no intention of doing anything really would make me angry.

	But you shouldn't really care about what my personal views are regarding the matter, you should do what is best for your software.
